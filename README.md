# FriendFinder
Friend finder app as part of the homework required for BootCampSpot
Somehow - this reminds me of the Bachelor game in the "Whose Line is it Anyway?" show 

Anyways - the app consists of a short survey (I have tried to make it easier by including sliders which will help you provide a relative view and instrospect if you really give the correct impression of yourself)

For next steps - I would love to use the NPM Open-CV package to also see if there are some similarities between the photo uploaded and that of the friends' ... but hey, before that , I need to make it possible for you to upload the photo first !
